Quick User Guide
=======================

Before you start using the PiPower 3, the initial step is to charge it. This is a standard recommendation for any battery-powered device you purchase. Often, these products will have been stored in a warehouse for some time before they reach you, and factors such as temperature, humidity, or other environmental conditions may have caused some discharge of the battery.

Therefore, it's advisable to fully charge the device before first use to avoid deep battery discharge.

For charging, we recommend using a 5V/5A PD charger, like the official Raspberry Pi 27W power supply. This ensures that the PiPower 3 can deliver a maximum current of 5A.

Once charged, you can use the PiPower 3 to power various boards.
