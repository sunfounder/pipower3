Use with Arduino Board
===================================

If you are using the PiPower 3 to power your Arduino board, you can connect the Arduino to the PiPower 3's Type A output port or use two jump wires. Connect the board's I2C interface using a jumper. If no operation is required before powering off, directly connect the **SDSIG** jumper cap to the GND. If operations are necessary before shutdown, remove the jumper cap and connect the intermediate wire to an IO port on the Arduino to notify PiPower 3 that it can safely power off.

We provide a library that allows you to monitor input and output voltages, battery voltage and percentage, power source, charging status, and other internal data.

#. In the Arduino IDE, open the **Library Manager**, search for ``SunFounderPowerControl``, and download and install it.

#. After the installation, you can navigate to **File** -> **Examples** -> **SunFounderPowerControl** -> **PiPower 3**, where you will find four examples.

    * ``read_all``: Use this example if you need to read all data at once and process them individually.
    * ``read_individual``: If you only need to read certain data, this example provides individual data retrieval instructions.
    * ``set_shutdown_percentage``: This example teaches how to set a shutdown battery percentage. This feature sends a shutdown signal to the host when the battery is not charging and falls below the set percentage. After the host shuts down, it will power off only after receiving a power-off signal. Typically used with SBCs like Raspberry Pi. For microcontrollers, remove the **SDSIG** jumper cap and connect the intermediate wire to a pin. After safely shutting down upon receiving the shutdown signal, pull this pin high to power off PiPower 3.
    * ``shutdown_when_request``: This example shows how to handle operations after receiving a shutdown signal. Remove the **SDSIG** jumper cap and connect the intermediate wire to a pin.

#. Choose one of the examples and upload it to your board.

.. note::

    On boards where the I2C pins can be modified, it is necessary to change the code in ``Wire.begin()``.
